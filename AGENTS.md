# AGENTS.md

This project is a web-based tool to help users determine if ventilating their
home will increase or decrease indoor humidity. It compares indoor and outdoor
air conditions (temperature and humidity) and provides a recommendation based
on the psychrometric chart.

## Agent Instructions

When modifying the code, please adhere to the following guidelines:

*   **Comments in English:** All code comments must be written in English.
*   **No Frameworks:** The project is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and
    CSS. Do not introduce any new frameworks (like React, Vue, etc.).
    TailwindCSS is used for styling, but no other CSS frameworks should be
    added.
*   **Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS:** All new code should be written using standard,
    vanilla web technologies.
*   **Native Web Components:** Use native web components to structure the
    application and encapsulate functionality where appropriate.
*   **Minimal Changes:** Only modify the code that is strictly necessary to
    implement the requested change. Do not refactor or restyle code that is
    not directly related to the user's request.
